# **Final Evaluation -  React**

## Project description

This project was built using React. The goal was to create a Rick & Morty's character finder through an API. It gives you a list of 20 characters and you can sort them by name, species, gender and status.

You can also click on any given character card to find more info about it.

## Steps

1. **Character's list:** A list with the first 20 characters returned by the API. Each character card has its name, picture and species.
2. **Filter:** To give the chance to find a character by its name.
3. **React components** The list had to have the following components:

- Filter by name
- List
- Character's card
- Detailed character's card

4. **Detailed character's card:** When you click on any given card, its information will apear in full-screen. For being able to do so, I used routes and React router. The card shows -in addition to what was shown before- the planet of origin, the status (alive, dead or unknown), and the number of chapters it's been at.

## Bonus

There were some bonuses such as:

- Visual improvements: responsive design, using a grid, using icons.
- Dinamic URLs and URLs for non existing characters
- Extra filters, such as species, gender or status
